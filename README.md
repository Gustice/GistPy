# GistPy

Clones all your (private) gists for you

Note: `py Clone.py` will dump all gists in current working directory.

You will be asked for user and password during execution.

Special Thanks to Jan-Piet Mens and his [Post](https://jpmens.net/2019/04/03/backup-all-my-gists/).
Unfortunately his script wasn't functional any more.

I just added user and password prompt and fixed the clone command.
